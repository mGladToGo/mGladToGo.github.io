<h2>CSS Layout Float</h2>
<p>In this example, we have created a header, two columns/boxes and a footer. On smaller screens, the columns will stack on top of each other.</p>
<p>Resize the browser window to see the responsive effect (you will learn more about this in our next chapter - HTML Responsive.)</p>

  <p> In his opening pitch for re-election, Anthony Albanese said: "We don't need to copy from any other nation to make Australia even better and stronger. We only need to trust in our values and back our people." It was Albanese's first, and I suspect not the last, attempt to evoke the image of Donald Trump and the chaos he is wreaking in the US and imply, but not directly say, that Opposition Leader Peter Dutton is attempting to borrow the same ideas and tactics here. Federal election 2025 live: Get the latest updates from the campaign trail with our blog Asked if he was referring to Trump, Albanese said people would "make their own judgements". "But people will have a look at the mass sackings of public servants," he said, referring to Dutton's promise to cull the Commonwealth public service by 41,000. In response, Dutton accused Albanese of starting a "sledge-a-thon" over Trump.</p>
